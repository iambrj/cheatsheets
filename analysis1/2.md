# Peano axioms

1. 0 is a natural number
2. If $n$ is a natural number, $n++$ is a natural number
3. 0 is not the successor of any natural number; i.e. $n++\neq 0, \forall n$
4. Different natural numbers have different successors; i.e. if $n, m$ are
    natural numbers such that $n\neq m$ then $n++\neq m++$
5. Let $P(n)$ be any property pertaining to a natural number $n$. Suppose that
    $P(0)$ is true, and whenever $P(n)$ is true, $P(n++)$ is also true. Then
    $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers.

- **Addition**: If $m$ is a natural number, then $0 + m := m$ and $(n++)+ m := (n + m)++$
- **Positive**: A natural number $n$ is said to be positive iff it is not equal to
  0
- **Ordering**: If $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers, we say $n$ is *greater than*
    or *equal to* $m$ and write $n\ge m$ or $m\le n$ iff we have $n = m + a$ for
    some natural number $a$. We say that $n$ is *strictly grater than m* and
    write $n > m$ or $m < n$
