# Axioms of set theory

1. **Sets are objects**: If $A$ is a set, then $A$ is also an object. In particular,
   given two sets A and B, it is meaningful to ask whether $A$ is also an
   element of $B$.
2. **Empty set**: There exists a set $\phi$, known as the empty set, which contains
   no elements, i.e., for every object $x$ we have $x\not\in\phi$.
3. **Singleton sets and pair sets**: If $a$ is an object, then there exists a set
   ${a}$ whose only element is $a$, i.e., for every object $y$, we have $y\in
   {a}$ iff $y = a$; we refer to ${a}$ as the singleton set whose element is
   $a$. Furthermore, if $a$ and $b$ are objects, then there eixsts a set ${a,
   b}$ whose only elements are $a$ and $b$; i.e., for every object $y$, we have
   $y\in {a, b}$ iff $y = a$ or $y = b$; we refer to this set as the *pair set
   formed by $a$ and $b$*.
4. **Pairwise union**: Given any two sets $A$ and $B$, there exists a set $A\cup B$,
   called the union of $A$ and $B$, whose elements consists of all the elements
   which belong to $A$ or $B$ or both.
   \begin{align*}
       x\in A\cup B\iff(x\in A or x\in B)
   \end{align*}
5. **Axiom of specification/separation**: If $A$ is a set, and $\forall x\in A$, $P(x)$ is
   a proposition in terms of $x$ then there exists a set $\{x\in A : P(x)\textrm{
   is true }\}$ whose elements are precisely the elements $x$ in $A$ for which
   $P(x)$ is true.
   \begin{align*}
       y\in\{x\in A : P(x)\textrm{ is true }\}\iff (y\in A\textrm{ and }
       P(y)\textrm{ is true})
   \end{align*}
6. **Axiom of replacement**: If $A$ is a set, then for any object $x\in A$ and
   any object $y$ there is a statement $P(x,y)$ such that $\forall x\in A$ there
   is at most $y$ for which $P(x,y)$ is true. Then there exists a set
   $\{y:P(x,y) \textrm{ true for some }x\in A\}$ such that for any object $z$
   \begin{align*}
   z\in\{y:P(x, y)\textrm{ true for some } x\in A\}\\
   \iff P(x, z)\textrm{ true for some }x\in A
   \end{align*}
   Observe that $6\implies 5$
7. **Axiom of Infinity**: There exists a set $N$ whose elements are called
   natural numbers, as well as an object $0\in N$ and an object $n++$ assigned
   to every $n\in N$, such that the Peano axioms hold
8. **Axiom of Regularity/Foundation**: If $A$ is a non-empty set then there is
   at least on element $x\in A$ which is either not a set or is disjoint from
   $A$.
   Observe that it tackles Russell's paradox by forcing at least one element in
   every set from a level below
9. **Power set axiom**: If $X$ and $Y$ are sets then there exists a set denoted
   by $Y^X$ which consists of all the functions from $X$ to $Y$.
   \begin{align*}
       f\in Y^X\iff (f\textrm{ is a function with domain $X$ and range $Y$})
   \end{align*}
10. **Union**: If $A$ is a set such that all its elements are themselves sets,
    then there exists a set $\cup A$ whose elements are precisely those objects
    which are elements of the elements of $A$
   \begin{align*}
       x\in\cup A\iff (x\in\textrm{ for some } S\in A)
   \end{align*}
   Observe that 10 and 3 imply 4

- **Set equality**: Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equal**, $A = B$, iff every
    element of $A$ is an element of $B$ and vice versa. In other words, $A = B$
    iff $\forall x\in A$, $x\in B$ and $\forall x\in B$, $x\in A$.
- **Subsets**: If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A$ is called a subset of $B$,
    denoted $A\subseteq B$, iff every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$
    \begin{align*}
        \forall x\in A, x\in B
    \end{align*}
- **Intersection**: The intersection $S_1\cap S_2$ of two sets is defined to be
    the set
    \begin{align*}
        S_1\cap S_2 := \{x\in S_1 : x\in S_2\}
    \end{align*}
- **Difference sets**: $\forall$ sets $A, B$; $A - B$ or $A\smallsetminus B$ is
  defined as the set
    \begin{align*}
        A\smallsetminus B := \{x\in A : x\not\in B\}
    \end{align*}
- Proposition: Sets form a boolean algebra (associativity, commutativity,
absorption, identity, distributivity, complements)

- Finite choice: If $n\geq 1$ is a natural number and for each natural number
    $1\leq i\leq n$ let $X_i$ be a nonempty set. Then there exists an n-tuple
    $(x_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}$ such that $x_i\in X_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$.
    Proof by induction.
- Ordinals: First, Second, Third etc used to order a sequence of objects.
    Cardinals: One, Two, Three, etc used to count how many things are in a set
- Equal cardinality: Tow sets $X$ and $Y$ have equal cardinality iff there
    exists a bijection $f:X\rightarrow Y$
- Proposition: Notion of having equal cardinality is an equivalence relation
