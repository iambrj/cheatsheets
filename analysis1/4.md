- Definition - Integers: An integers is an expression of the form $a \Xi b$ where
    $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers. Two integers are considered to be equal,
    $a\Xi b = c\Xi d$ iff $a+d=c+b$
- Definition - Integer sum: The sum of two integers $a\Xi b$ and $c\Xi d$ is
    defined as $(a+c)\Xi (b+d)$.
- Definition - Negation: If $a\Xi b$ is an integer then the negation, $-(a\Xi
    b)$ is defined as the integer $b\Xi a$
