- Definition - sequence: a sequence is a mapping from the integers to the
    rationals, for example $(n^2)_{n=0}^\infty$
- Definiton - $\epsilon$ steadiness: a sequence $a_0,a_1,\dots$ is $\epsilon$
    steady iff $\forall j, k,\;d(a_j, a_k)\leq\epsilon$
- Definition - eventual $\epsilon$ steadiness: a sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$
    is eventually $\epsilon$ steady iff the sequence $a_N, a_{N+1},\dots$ is
    $\epsilon$ steady for some natural number $N\geq 0$
- Definition - Cauchy sequences: a sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ of rational
    numbers is said to be a Cauchy sequence iff for every rational $\epsilon >
    0$, the sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$is eventually $\epsilon$ steady
    Intuition - you can make the difference between elements arbitrarily close
    to zero if you go sufficiently farther into the sequence
- Definition - Bounded sequence: a finite sequence $(a_i)_{i=1}^n$ is bounded by
    $M$ iff $|a_i|\leq M$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$. An infinite sequence
    $(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ is bounded by $M$ iff $|a_i|\leq M$ for all $i\geq 1$
- Definition - $\epsilon$ close sequences: two sequences $(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$
    and $(b_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ are $\epsilon$ close iff $a_n$ is $\epsilon$
    close to $b_n$ for each $n\in N$
- Definition - Equivalent sequences: two sequences $(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ and
  $(b_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ are equivalent iff for each rational $\epsilon > 0$,
  they are eventually $\epsilon$ close
- Definition - Real numbers: A real number is defined as an object of the form
    $lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_n$ where $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy
    sequence of real numbers. Two real numbers are equal if their Cauchy
    sequences are equivalent.
- Proposition: equality is well defined.
- Definition: A sequence $(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ of rational numbers is said to
    be bounded away from zero iff there exists a rational number $c>0$ such that
    $|a_n|\geq c$ for all $n\geq 1$
- Lemma: If $x$ is a non zero real number, then it is the limit of some Cauchy
    sequence bounded away from zero.
- Definition - sequences bounded away from zero: A sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
    of rational numbers is said to be *bounded away from zero* iff $\exists$
    rational number $c>0$ such that $|a_n|\geq c, \forall n\geq 1$
