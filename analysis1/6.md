- Definition - Convergence of sequences: $\epsilon > 0$ and $L$ are real
    numbers, then a sequence $(a_n)_{n=N}^\infty$ of real numbers is said to
    converge to $L$ iff $\exists N$ such that $\forall n\geq N, |a_n -
    L|\leq\epsilon$
- Limits are unique
- Definition - Limit points: If $(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$ is a sequence of real
    numbers and $x$ is a real number then $x$ is said to be a *limit point* of
    $(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$ iff $\forall\epsilon > 0, \exists N$ such that
    $\exists a_i\;\epsilon$ close to $x, \forall i \geq N$. Intuitively, one can
    always find elements arbitrarily close to $x$ by going sufficiently deeper
    into the sequence.
- Remark: The difference between convergence and limit points is that
    the former requires *every* element to be $\epsilon$ close after sufficient
    depth, but the latter only requires *at least* one element to be $\epsilon$
    close after sufficient depth. In other words, it is universal vs existential
    qualification
- Proposition : Limits are limit points
- Definition - Limit superior
\begin{gather*}
limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n := inf(a_N^+)_{N=m}^\infty
\end{gather*}
where
\begin{gather*}
a_N^+ := sup(a_n)_{n=N}^\infty
\end{gather*}
- Definition - Limit inferior
\begin{gather*}
    liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n := sup(a_N^-)_{N=m}^\infty
\end{gather*}
where
\begin{gather*}
a_N^- := inf(a_n)_{n=N}^\infty
\end{gather*}
Intuitively, these are smallest upper bound and greatest lower bound *at
infinity*
- Lemma - Continuity of exponentiation: If $x > 0$, $\alpha$ is a real
    number, $(q_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of rational numbers converging to
    $\alpha$ then $(x^{q_n})_{n=1}^\infty$ is also a convergent sequence
