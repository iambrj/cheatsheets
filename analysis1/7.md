- Definition - Finite series : if $(a_i)_{i=m}^n$ is a finite sequence of real
    numbers, then the finite sum is defined recursively as
    \begin{gather*}
    \sum_{i=m}^n := 0, n < m\\
    \sum_{i=m}^{n+1} := (\sum_{i=m}^n a_i)+a_{n+1}, n \ge m - 1
    \end{gather*}
- Definition - Summation over finite sets: If $X$ is a finite set of size
    $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and $g$ a bijection form the
    first $n$ natural numbers to $X$, then
    \begin{gather*}
    \sum_{x\in X}f(x):=\sum_{i=1}^n f(g(i))
    \end{gather*}
- Definition - Infinite series: An infinite series is any expression of the form
    \begin{gather*}
    \sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n
    \end{gather*}
    where $m$ is an integer and $a_n$ is a real number for all $n$
- Definiton - Convergence of series : For the series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$
    define $S_N:=\sum_{n=m}^N a_n$ for all $N\ge m$. If the sequence
    $(S_N)_{n=m}^\infty$ converges to some limit $L$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$
    then the series is said to be convergent and converges to $L$.
- Proposition: The series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ converges iff,
  $\forall\epsilon > 0$, $\exists N\ge m$ such that
    \begin{gather*}
    |\sum_{n=p}^q a_n| \leq\epsilon, \textrm{ for all } p, q\geq N
    \end{gather*}
- Proposition - Zero test: $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ is convergent iff
    $lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n = 0$
- A series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ is said to be **absolutely convergent** iff
    the series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty |a_n|$ is convergent
- If $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ is non-negative, decreasing sequence then
  $\sum_{n=m}^\infty (-1)^na_n$ is convergent iff the sequence $a_n$ converges
  to 0 as $n\rightarrow\infty$
- Proposition: The series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ of nonnegative reals is
    convergent iff $\exists M\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
    \begin{gather*}
    \sum_{n=m}^Na_n\leq M, \forall N\geq m
    \end{gather*}
    In other words, if $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ and $\sum_{n=m}^\infty b_n$ are
    two series of real numbers such that $|a_n|\leq b_n, \forall n\geq m$ then
    if the latter is convergent, the former is absolutely convergent and
    \begin{gather*}
    |\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n|\leq\sum_{n=m}^\infty|a_n|\leq\sum_{n=m}^\infty b_n
    \end{gather*}
