# Preface

- Crisis in the humanities : is there any point in studying our artistic and
    cultural inheritance, when the judgement of its beauty has no rational
    grounds
- Philosophical approach to beauty

# Judging beauty

- Judge beauty in : objects, abstract ideas, people, qualities, actions, proofs
  etc; every ontological category
- Metaphors make connections not present in the fabric of reality but created by
    human associative powers. Ask not what it stands for, but what experience it
    suggests
- Is beautiful a metaphor?
- Trio of values which need to further arguments to be pursued : true, good,
    beauty
- Beauty may oppose goodness (committing vices in romantic pursuits) and truth (myths)
- Aquinas's claim : goodness, truth and unity are transcendentals possessed by
    all things as they are aspects of being
- Axioms of beauty
    1. Beauty pleases us
    2. One thing can be more beautiful than another
    3. Beauty is always a reason for attending to the thing that possesses it
    4. Beauty is the subject-matter of a judgement : the judgement of taste
    5. The judgement of taste is about the beautiful object, not about the
       subject's state of mind
    6. There are no second-hand judgements of beauty
- If an object claims to stand out, it must truly be worthy of its claim - the
    goal is to usually fit in.
- Judgement of beauty as a justification of taste
- 17th/18th century Enlightenment thinkers' approach : art has an aspect beyond
    utility
- Architect Louis Sullivan : beauty is observed by seeing how function of a
    thing is expressed in its observable features - form follows function
- Something is beautiful if we gain pleasure from contemplating it as an
    individual object, for its own sake, and in its presented form.
- Kant : aesthetic theory of disinterest. Also see categorical imperative.
- Disinterested pleasure : not *from* or *that*, but *in*. It is contemplative,
    feeding upon the presented form of its object, and constantly renewing
    itself from that source
- Is beauty perrogative : need language, self-consciousness, reason, moral
    judgement

# Human beauty

- Controversy in evolutionary psychologists : group selection vs individual
    selection
    * Group selection
      + Aura around functions necessary for group survival - marriage,
        festivals, weapons etc to protect from emotional erosion
      + Collective group need to make special
      + Falls short to explain what is distinctive of the aesthetic
- Plato's seventh platitude

> Beauty, in a person, prompts desire

- Hume : beauty spreads itself upon objects
- Eros : origin of both love of beauty and sexual desire
- Plato's argument
    + Soul longs for immortality
    + Eros seeks to unify with its object and make copies
    + Base manifestation of eros is erotic love, sexual reproduction
    + Higher/Abstract manifestation of eros is contemplation and replication in
      forms world
    + Beauty achieves immortality through this replication
- What prompts sexual attraction can be contemplated but never possessed,
    consummation may temporarily quench it, but what inspires it is always
    beyond our reach
- Sexual *drives* vs Eros *choice*
- Obscenity : deliberate eclipse of a person's embodiment by their body, eclipse
    of the soul by the body
- Attract contemplation vs prompt desire
- Human beauty : face, eyes, mouth and hands
- Parallels & relations between the sacred and the beautiful
- Beauty is both an invitation to desire and a call to renounce it
- Moral objection to the $7^{th}$ platitude : babies and children are also
    beautiful
- $7^{th}$ platitude rewritten

> It is a non-accidental feature of human beauty that it prompts desire
