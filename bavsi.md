# Preface

- Crisis in the humanities : is there any point in studying our artistic and
    cultural inheritance, when the judgement of its beauty has no rational
    grounds
- Philosophical approach to beauty

# Judging beauty

- Judge beauty in : objects, abstract ideas, people, qualities, actions, proofs
  etc; every ontological category
- Metaphors make connections not present in the fabric of reality but created by
    human associative powers. Ask not what it stands for, but what experience it
    suggests
- Is beautiful a metaphor?
- Trio of values which need to further arguments to be pursued : true, good,
    beauty
- Beauty may oppose goodness (committing vices in romantic pursuits) and truth (myths)
- Aquinas's claim : goodness, truth and unity are transcendentals possessed by
    all things as they are aspects of being
- Axioms of beauty
    1. Beauty pleases us
    2. One thing can be more beautiful than another
    3. Beauty is always a reason for attending to the thing that possesses it
    4. Beauty is the subject-matter of a judgement : the judgement of taste
    5. The judgement of taste is about the beautiful object, not about the
       subject's state of mind
    6. There are no second-hand judgements of beauty
- If an object claims to stand out, it must truly be worthy of its claim - the
    goal is to usually fit in.
- Judgement of beauty as a justification of taste
- 17th/18th century Enlightenment thinkers' approach : art has an aspect beyond
    utility
- Architect Louis Sullivan : beauty is observed by seeing how function of a
    thing is expressed in its observable features - form follows function
- Something is beautiful if we gain pleasure from contemplating it as an
    individual object, for its own sake, and in its presented form.
- Kant : aesthetic theory of disinterest. Also see categorical imperative.
- Disinterested pleasure : not *from* or *that*, but *in*. It is contemplative,
    feeding upon the presented form of its object, and constantly renewing
    itself from that source
- Is beauty perrogative : need language, self-consciousness, reason, moral
    judgement
