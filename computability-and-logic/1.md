* An **enumerable**/**countable** set is one whose members can be enumerated:
	arranged in a single list with a first entry, a second entry, and so on, so
	that every member of the set appears sooner or later on the list.
* The empty set is regarded as enumerable by convention
* An infinite set that is enumerable is said to be enumerably infinite or
	denumerable
* In an acceptable list, each item must appear sooner or later as the *n*th
	entry, for some *finite* n. Therefore lists of the kind 1, 3, 5,..., 2, 4,
	6,... are not acceptable
* An infinite list determines a *function* that takes integers are *arguments* and
	returns members of the set as *values*.
* In enumerating a set by listing its members, it is perfectly all right if a
	member of the set shows up more than once - the requirement is that each
	member show up *at least* once.
