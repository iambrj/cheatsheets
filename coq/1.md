# Function definition
```
Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday => tuesday
  | tuesday => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday => friday
  | friday => monday
  | saturday => monday
  | sunday => monday
  end.

# Three ways to check that a function works:w
## Compute
* Use `Compute` to evaluate a compound expression involving next_weekday.
```
Compute (next_weekday friday).
(* ==> monday : day *)
Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).
(* ==> tuesday : day *)
```
## Example
* Use `Example` to record what we expect the result to be
```
Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.
```

TODO: later chapter
# Notation
* Use `Notation` to to define a new symbolic notation for existing definition
```
Notation "x && y" := (andb x y).
Notation "x || y" := (orb x y).
```
# Check
* Use `Check` to print the type of an expression
# Pattern matching
* Use `_` to match with any constructor
# Modules
* If we enclose a collection of declarations between `Module X` and `End X`
    markers then in the remainder of the file after end these declarations are
    referred to as `X.foo` instead of just `foo`.
# Tuple
```
Inductive bit : Type :=
  | B0
  | B1.
Inductive nybble : Type :=
  | bits (b0 b1 b2 b3 : bit).
```
# Fixpoint
* Use `Fixpoint` to define recursive functions
```
Fixpoint evenb (n:nat) : bool :=
  match n with
  | O ⇒ true
  | S O ⇒ false
  | S (S n') ⇒ evenb n'
  end.
```
* As a notational convenience, if two or more arguments have the same type, they
  can be written together. In the following definition, `(n m : nat)` means just
  the same as if we had written `(n : nat) (m : nat)`
```
Fixpoint mult (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O ⇒ O
    | S n' ⇒ plus m (mult n' m)
  end.
```
* You can match two expressions at once by putting a comma between them:
```
Fixpoint minus (n m:nat) : nat :=
  match n, m with
  | O , _ ⇒ O
  | S _ , O ⇒ n
  | S n', S m' ⇒ minus n' m'
  end.
```
# Arithmetic
```
Notation "x + y" := (plus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation "x - y" := (minus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation "x * y" := (mult x y)
                       (at level 40, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope
```
* The keywords `intros`, `simpl`, and `reflexivity` are examples of tactics. A
  tactic is a command that is used between Proof and Qed to guide the process of
  checking some claim we are making
# Proof by simplificaton
* The fact that 0 is a "neutral element" for + on the left can be proved just by
    observing that 0 + n reduces to n no matter what n is, a fact that can be read
    directly off the definition of plus.
```
Theorem plus_O_n : \forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
```
# Proof by rewriting
* If we are assuming `n = m`, then we can replace `n` with `m` in the goal statement and
    obtain an equality with the same expression on both sides. The tactic that
    tells Coq to perform this replacement is called rewrite.
```
Theorem plus_id_example : \forall n m:nat,
  n = m ->
  n + n = m + m.
Proof.
  (* move both quantifiers into the context: *)
  intros n m.
  (* move the hypothesis into the context: *)
  intros H.
  (* rewrite the goal using the hypothesis: *)
  rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity. Qed.
```
# Proof by cases
* The tactic that tells Coq to consider, separately, the cases where `n = O` and
where `n = S n'` is called destruct.
```
Theorem plus_1_neq_0 : ∀n : nat,
  (n + 1) <> 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity. Qed.
```
* The annotation `as [| n']` is called an intro pattern. It tells Coq what
variable names to introduce in each subgoal. In general, what goes between the
square brackets is a list of lists of names, separated by `|`. In this case, the
first component is empty, since the `O` constructor is nullary (it doesn't have
any arguments). The second component gives a single name, `n'`, since `S` is a
unary constructor.
* It is sometimes useful to invoke destruct inside a subgoal, generating yet
  more proof obligations. In this case, we use different kinds of bullets to
  mark goals on different "levels." For example:
```
Theorem andb_commutative : \forall b c, andb b c = andb c b.
Proof.
  intros b c. destruct b eqn:Eb.
  - destruct c eqn:Ec.
    + reflexivity.
    + reflexivity.
  - destruct c eqn:Ec.
    + reflexivity.
    + reflexivity.
Qed.
```
* Note that the destruct here has no as clause because none of the subcases of the
destruct need to bind any variables, so there is no need to specify any names.
(We could also have written as [|], or as [].). Besides - and +, we can use *
(asterisk) as a third kind of bullet.
