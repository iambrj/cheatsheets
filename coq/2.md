# Proof by induction
* For the Require Export to work, Coq needs to be able to find a compiled version
of Basics.v, called Basics.vo, in a directory associated with the prefix LF.
This file is analogous to the .class files compiled from .java source files and
the .o files compiled from .c files.
```
From LF Require Export Basics.
```
* A `_CoqProject` file should have project name as follows
```
-Q . LF
```
* Use
```
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject *.v -o Makefile
```
to generate a makefile. Then you can compile `Basics.v` by running make with the
corresponding `.vo` file as a target:
```
make Basics.vo
```
* Under the hood, make uses the Coq compiler, coqc. You can also run coqc directly:
```
coqc -Q . LF Basics.v
```
# `induction` tactic

Theorem plus_n_O : forall n:nat, n = n + 0.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = 0 *) reflexivity.
  - (* n = S n' *) simpl. rewrite <- IHn'. reflexivity. Qed.
```
# Assert
* It is convenient to be able to simply state and prove the needed "sub-theorem"
right at the point where it is used. The assert tactic allows us to do this.
```
Theorem mult_0_plus' : ∀n m : nat,
  (0 + n) * m = n * m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  assert (H: 0 + n = n). { reflexivity. }
  rewrite → H.
  reflexivity. Qed.
```
