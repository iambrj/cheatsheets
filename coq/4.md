* The Arguments directive specifies the name of the function (or constructor) and
  then lists its argument names, with curly braces around any arguments to be
  treated as implicit. (If some arguments of a definition don't have a name, as is
  often the case for constructors, they can be marked with a wildcard pattern `_`.)
```
    Arguments nil {X}.
    Arguments cons {X} _ _.
    Arguments repeat {X} x count.
```
* Alternatively, we can declare an argument to be implicit when defining the
  function itself, by surrounding it in curly braces instead of parens. For
  example:
```
Fixpoint repeat''' {X : Type} (x : X) (count : nat) : list X :=
  match count with
  | 0 ⇒ nil
  | S count' ⇒ cons x (repeat''' x count')
  end.
```
