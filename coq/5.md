* To use the apply tactic, the (conclusion of the) fact being applied must match
  the goal exactly
# Injection and discriminate
* The same principles apply to all inductively defined types: all constructors
  are injective, and the values built from distinct constructors are never equal

Theorem trans_eq : forall(X : Type) (n m o : X),
    n = m -> m = o -> n = o.
Proof.
  intros X n m o eq1 eq2.
  rewrite -> eq1.
  rewrite -> eq2.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

Example trans_eq_example : forall(a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  apply trans_eq with (m := [c;d]).
  apply eq1.
  apply eq2.

# `injection`
```
Inductive nat : Type :=
  | O : nat
  | S : nat â†’ nat.
```
* The constructor `S` is injective. That is, if `S n = S m,` it must be the case
  that `n = m`.
* The constructors `O` and `S` are disjoint. That is, `O` is not equal to `S n` for any
  `n`.
* Coq provides a tactic called `injection` that allows us to exploit the
  injectivity of any constructor
```
```
* By writing injection `H` at this point, we are asking Coq to generate all
  equations that it can infer from `H` using the injectivity of constructors
