# FS vs DBMS
* FSs have limited memory
* Even with virtual memory, more than 2^32 (~4GB) addressing not possible
* Queries slower - as data large
* Need for consistency adds complexity
* Crash recovery
* Security
# Advantages of DBMS (IIESAAC)
* Data **I**ndependence
* Data **I**ntegrity
* **E**fficient access
* **S**ecurity
* Data **A**dministration
* Reduced **A**pplication development time
* **C**oncurrent access
* **C**rash recovery
# Levels of abstraction
* **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: used to define the external and conceptual
	schemas
## Conceptual Schema
* **Conceptual/Logical Schema**: describes the stored data in terms of the data
	model of the dbms
* **Conceptual Database Design**: process of arriving at a good conceptual
	schema
## Physical Schema
* **Physical Schema**: used to specify additional storage details - summarizes
	how the relations described in the conceptual schema are actually stored on
	secondary storage devices
## External Schema
* **External Schema**: allow data access to be customized at the level of
	individual users or groups of users
# Data Independence
* Application programs should be insulated from the way data is structured and
	stored
## Logical Data Independence
* Users being shielded from changes in the logical structure of the data, or
	change in the choice of relations to be stored
## Physical Data Independence
* Users being insulated from the changes in the physical storage details
# Glossary
* **Data model**: collection of high level data description constructs that hide
	many low-level storage details
* **Semantic data model**: more abstract, high level data model that makes it
	easier for a user to come up with a good initial description of the data in
	an enterprise
* **Relation**: set of records
* **Schema**: a description of data in terms of a data model
* **Field**: attribute or column
* **Integrity constraints**: conditions that the records in a relation must
	satisfy
* **Transaction**: any one execution of a user program in DBMS
