# Database design
1. **Requirements analysis**: understand what data is to be stored in the
	database, what applications must be built on top of it, and what operations
	are most frequent and subject to performance requirements i.e., what do the
	users want?
2. **Conceptual Database Design**: develop high-level description of data to be
	stored in database using info from step 1. Generate ER schema.
3. **Logical Database Design**: convert ER schema to relational database schema
## Beyond ER
4. **Schema Refinement**: normalization, identify potential problems and resolve
5. **Physical Database Design**: consider typical expected workload and further
   refine. Indexing and clustering
6. **Application and Security Design**: beyond database
# Glossary
* **Entity**: an object in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects
* **Entity Set**: collection of similar entities
* **Attributes**: elements used to describe entities. All entities in a given
	entity set have *similar* attributes
* **Key**: minimal set of attributes whose values uniquely identify an entity in
	a given set
* **Primary key**: a designated key from available keys
* **Candidate keys**: all other keys
* **Relationship**: an association among two or more entities
* **Relationship set**: a set of similar relationships; can be thought of as a
	set of n-tuples `{(e1, ..., en) | e1 ∈ E1, ..., en ∈ En}`
* **Descriptive attributes**: used to record information about the relationship,
	rather than about nay one of the participating entities
