* Two most important characteristics of good design - discoverability and
	understanding
* Industrial design: professional service of creating and developing concepts
	and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of
	products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
* Interaction design: focus on how people interact with technology
* Experience design: focus on quality and enjoyment of total experience
* It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people
* Accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be
* Design machines on the assumption that people will make errors
* **Human centered design**: put human needs, capabilities, and behavior first
* Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology
* Focus on cases where things go wrong
* Good designers produce pleasurable experiences - it determines how fondly
	people remember their interactions
# Affordances
* It refers to the **relationship** between a physical object and a
	person/interacting agent - capabilities of the agent and the properties of
	the object
* Affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the
	abilities of the interacting agent
* To be effective, affordances and anti-affordances have to be discoverable -
	otherwise, some means of signaling its presence is required. Perceived
	affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the
	need of signifiers.
# Signifiers
* Affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where
	the action should take place
* Good design requires good communication of purpose, structure and operation
* Signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that
	communicates appropriate behaviour to a person
* Signifiers are more important than affordances
* Profound ideas are always obvious once they are understood
# Mappings
* Relationship between the elements of two sets of things
* Natural mapping leads to immediate understanding
* Related controls should be grouped together, controls should be close to the
	item being controlled
# Feedback
* Feedback communicates the result of an action
* Feedback must be immediate and informative
* Poor feedback is worse than no feedback
* Too much feedback is more annoying than too little
* Worst of all is inappropriate, uninterpretable feedback
* Feedback must be planned, unobtrusive, prioritized
# Conceptual models
* A conceptual model is an explanation of how something works
* Useful over complete and accurate
* Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that support
	them hold true
* Conceptual models are often inferred from the device itself
* A good conceptual model enable use to predict the effects of our actions
# The System Image
* The combined information we have available to us
* Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good
	communication is the key to good conceptual models
