# Definitions

* **Token**: pair of token name (an abstract symbol representing a kind of
    lexical unit e.g. a particular keyword, a sequence of input chars denoting
    an identifier etc) and attribute(s). Examples include `id` for identifiers
    and a pointer to the symbol table entry for that identifier as an attribute,
    `number` and the value of that number as an attribute etc.
* **Pattern**: description of the form that the lexemes of a token may take.
* **Lexeme**: sequence of characters in source program matching the pattern for
  a token. For example, `2037` is a lexeme matching the pattern for the token
  `number`.

# Input buffering

Use two buffers for look ahead and use two pointers `lexemeBegin` and `forward`
to iterate through the two buffers. 

# Token specification

## Definitions

* **Alphabet**: any _finite_ set of symbols
* **String**: a _finite_ sequence of symbols drawn from an alphabet
* **Language**: any _countable_ set of strings over some fixed alphabet
* **Empty string**: string of length zero, denoted by $\epsilon$
* **Prefix**: string obtained by removing zero or more symbols from the end of
    another string
* **Suffix**: string obtained by removing zero or more symbols from the
    beginning of another string
* **Substring**: string obtained by removing any prefix and any suffix from
    another string
* **Proper** prefix/suffix/substring: prefixes/suffixes/substrings that are not
    the string itself or $\epsilon$
* **Subsequence**: string obtained by removing _any_ symbols from another
    string

## Operations on languages

* **Union**: $L\cup M = \{s | s\in L \text{ or } s\in M\}$
* **Concatenation**: $LM = \{st | s\in L \text{ and } t\in M\}$
* **Kleene closure**: $L^* = \cup_{i=0}^{\infty}L^i$
* **Positive closure**: $L^* = \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}L^i$

## Regular Expressions

**Definition** (over alphabet $\Sigma$)

1. $\epsilon$ is a regular expression and $L(\epsilon) = \{epsilon\}$
2. $\forall a\in L$, **a** is a regular expression and $L(\text{**a**}) = {a}$
3. $(r) | (s)$ is a regular expression denoting the language $L(r)\cup L(s)$
4. $(r)(s)$ is a regular expression denoting
   language $L(r)L(s)$
5. $(r)*$ is a regular expression denoting the language $(L(r))*$
6. $(r)$ is a regular expression denoting the language $L(r)$

## Extensions

* **+**: one or more instances
* **?**: zero or more instances
* **Character classes**: [a-z] etc

## Token recognition
* **Transition diagrams**: collection of nodes/circles (states) and edges from
    one state to another labelled with symbol(s).

## Finite Automata
* A **nondeterministic finite automaton** (NFA) consists of
    - A _finite_ set of states, $S$
    - A set of input symbols, $\Sigma$ (assumption: $\epsilon\not\in\Sigma$)
    - A transition function, $\delta:S\times(\Sigma\cup\{\epsilon\})\rightarrow 2^S$
    - A state $s_0\in S$ called the start state
    - $F\subseteq S$, the accepting states
