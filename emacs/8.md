# Minibuffer
* `C-a C-k` - kill entire minibuffer. Alternately, ignore default and enter
  absolute file name starting with a slash or tilde
* `<TAB>`, `<SPC>` and `?` bound to autocomplete
* When minibuffer is active, the echo area is treated much like an ordinary
  Emacs window - can jump around with `C-x o`
* `resize-mini-windows` - variable controls resizing of minibuffer
* `max-mini-window-height` - variable controls max minibuffer height
* set `enable-recursive-minibuffers` to `t` for recursive minibuffers
