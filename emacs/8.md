# Minibuffer
* `C-a C-k` - kill entire minibuffer. Alternately, ignore default and enter
  absolute file name starting with a slash or tilde
* `<TAB>`, `<SPC>` and `?` bound to autocomplete
* When minibuffer is active, the echo area is treated much like an ordinary
  Emacs window - can jump around with `C-x o`
* `resize-mini-windows` - variable controls resizing of minibuffer
* `max-mini-window-height` - variable controls max minibuffer height
* set `enable-recursive-minibuffers` to `t` for recursive minibuffers
# Completion
* `<TAB>` - auto-complete as much as possible
* `<SPC>` - auto complete upto one word
* `<RET>` - sumbit whatever is there
* `?` - show completion options, `<RIGHT>`/`<LEFT>` to navigate options
## Completion exit
* Strict completion - allow exit iff exact completion match
* Cautious completion - strict completion with extra `<RET>`
* Permissive completion - submit whatever is typed
* Permissive completion with confirmation
* `completion-styles` - variable specifying competion style
  - `basic` : before point match as beginning, after point substring
  - `partial-completion` : split at spaces/hyphens and match
  - `emacs22` : like basic, but ignore after point
  - `substring` : both before and after as substrings (in that order)
  - `initials` : complete accronyms and initialisms
* `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case` : `nil`/`non-nil`
* `completion-ignored-extensions` : list of file extensions to ignore during
  autocomplete
* `completion-auto-help`
  - `nil` : completion commands never display completion list buffer, type `?`
  - `lazy` : completion list displayed on second attempt to complete
* `completion-cycle-threshold`
  - `t` : completes to first alternative
  - `<N>` : switch to cycling behaviour if `<N>` or fewer commands
## Minibuffer history
* Every argument entered into the minibuffer is saved in a "minibuffer history list"
  - `M-p` : move to previous item
  - `M-n` : move to next item
  - `<UP>`, `<DOWN>` : move to previous/next line of a multi-line item before going to previous history item
  - `M-r REGEXP <RET>`: move to earlier item that matches `REGEXP`
  - `M-s REGEXP <RET>` : move to later item that matches `REGEXP`
# Repeating minibuffer commands
* `C-x <ESC> <ESC>` : Re-execute a recent minibuffer command from the command history
* `M-x list-command-history` : display entire command history
