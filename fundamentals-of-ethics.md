- Three schools of moral philosophy
    1. Value theory : What is the good life? What is worth pursuing for its own
       sake? How do we improve our lot in life?
    2. Normative ethics : What are our fundamental moral duties? Which character
       traits count as virtues, which as vices, and why? Who should our role
       models be? Do the ends always justify the means, or are there certain
       types of actions that should never be done under any circumstances?
    3. Metaethics : what is the status of moral claims and advice? Can ethical
       theories, moral principles, or specific oral verdicts be true? If so,
       what makes them true? Can we gain moral wisdom? If so, how? Do we always
       have good reason to do our moral duty?
- Constraints on morality / starting points for morality
    1. Neither the law nor tradition is immune from moral criticism
    2. Everyone is morally fallible
    3. Friendship is valuable
    4. We are not obligated to do the impossible
    5. Children bear less moral responsibility than adults
    6. Justice is a very important moral good
    7. Deliberately hurting other people requires justification
    8. Equals ought to be treated equally
    9. Self-interest isn't the only ethical consideration
    10. Agony is bad
    11. Might doesn't make right
    12. Free and informed requests prevent rights violations
- Moral reasoning = (Set of reasons, conclusions these reasons are meant to
    support)
- Two major errors
    * Arrive at wrong conclusion by false premises
    * Arrive at right conclusion by wrong arguments
- In best arguments, truth of the premises guarantees truth of the conclusion
- Sound arguments : logically valid + all premises true
- Moral agents : entities that can control their behavior through moral
    reasoning

# Hedonism

- Instrumental goods : things that are valuable because of the good things they
    bring about
- Intrinsically valuable : things that are worth pursuing for their own sake,
    even if it brings nothing else in its wake
- A good life will contain many elements that are good for their own sake
- Hedonism : a life is good to the extent that it is filled with pleasure and is
    free of pain (*not* physical pleasure, attitudinal pleasure)
- Justifications for Hedonism
    + It justifies "there are many models of a good life", since there are many
        paths to happiness
    + Places emphasis on personal authority and everyone who denies happiness to
        be ultimate good are wrong
    + Explanation is limited : happiness is intrinsically valuable is an axiom
    + Enjoyment enhances the quality of life -- irrespective of physical
        pleasure (e.g. masochists may enjoy physical pain)
