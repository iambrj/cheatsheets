A regular expression can be used as a pattern by enclosing it in slashes.
```
awk '/li/ { print $2 }' filename
```

# Regular expression comparision
`exp ~ /regexp/` is true if  `exp` matches `regexp`
```
awk '$1 ~ /J/' filename # All input records with 'J' in the first field
```

`exp !~ /regexp/` is true if `exp` does not match `regexp`

A regular expression enclosed in slashes (`/foo/`) is called a *regexp constant*
