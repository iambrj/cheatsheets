A regular expression can be used as a pattern by enclosing it in slashes.
```
awk '/li/ { print $2 }' filename
```

# Regular expression comparision
`exp ~ /regexp/` is true if  `exp` matches `regexp`
```
awk '$1 ~ /J/' filename # All input records with 'J' in the first field
```

`exp !~ /regexp/` is true if `exp` does not match `regexp`

A regular expression enclosed in slashes (`/foo/`) is called a *regexp constant*

# Escape sequences
* Escape sequences are character sequences beginning with a backslash
## Escape sequences in awk
|	Sequence	|		Meaning			|
|	--------	|		------			|
|	`\\`		|	literal backslash	|	
|	`\a`		|	alert character		|
|	`\b`		|	backspace			|
|	`\f`		|	formfeed			|
|	`\n`		|	newline				|
|	`\r`		|	carriage return		|
|	`\t`		|	horizontal tab		|
|	`\v`		|	vertical tab		|
|	`\nnn`		|	octal value `nnn`	|
|	`\xhh`		|	hexadecimal value `hh` |
|	`\/`		|	a literal slash		|
|	`\"`		|	a literal double quote |

# Regular Expression operators
|		Operator		|		Interpretation		|
|		--------		|		--------------		|
|			`\`			| Supresses the special meaning of a character when matching	|
|			`^`			| Match beginning of the string |
|			`$`			| Match end of the string	|
|			`.`			| Match single character, including newline	|
|		`[...]`			| Match any one character enclosed |
|		`[^...]`		| Match *NOT* one character enclosed |
|			`|`			| Alternation operator		|
|		`(...)`			| Arithmetic grouping	|
|		`*`				| Repeat preceding regex any number of times |
|		`+`				| Like `*`, but atleast one match |
|		`?`				| Like `?`, but once or not at all |
| `{n}`, `{n}`, `{n, m}` | Repeat preceding regex between `n` and `m` times |	

# Charcter classes
|		Class		|		Meaning		|
|		----		|		-------		|
|	`[:alnum:]`		|	Alphanumeric	|
|	`[:alpha:]`		| Alphabetic		|
|	`[:blank:]`		| Space/tabs		|
|	`[:cntrl:]`		| 		Control		|
|	`[:digit:]`		|	Numeric			|
|	`[:graph:]`		|	Printable & visible |
|	`[:lower:]`		|	Lowercase alphabet |
|	`[:print:]`		|	|
|	`[:punct:]`		|	Punctuation	|
|	`[:space:]`		|	Space characters |
|	`[:upper:]`		|	Uppercase alpha	|
|	`[:xdigit:]`	|	Hexadecimal characters |

# Bracket expressions
* Multicharacter collating elements enclosed between `[.` and `.]`
* Locale specific characters that are equal are enclosed between `[=` and `=]`

### `awk` regex always match leftmost, longest sequence
