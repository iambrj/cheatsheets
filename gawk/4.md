* If input files are specified, awk reads them in order, processing all the data
  from one before going on to the next.
* input -> record -> field
* The predefined variable `FNR` keeps track of the number of records that have
  been read so far in current file
* The predefined variable `NR` keeps track of the total number of input records
  read so far from all files
* Records are separated by a character called the *record separator* (by default
  newline)
* To use a different character for the record separator, assign that character
  to the predefined variable `RS`. The new record separator should be enclosed
  in quotation marks, indicating a string constant
* The built-in variable `NF` is the number of fields in the current record
* The empty string `""` means records that are separated by one or more blank
  lines and nothing else
* `RS` can be any regular expression when using `gawk`
* The general rule for record splitting is: each record ends at the beginning of
  the next matching string and the following record starts just after the end of
  this string.
* `RT` contains the text that matched the regular expression. If the input file
  ends without any text matching `RS`, `gawk` sets RT to the null string
