* Use `do` operator to execute a sequence of actions in a particular order
* Use `read` to convert from `String` to `Num`
* Use `show` to convert from `Num` to `String`
* Use `putStrLn` to print to output
* Use `getLine` to get next line
* Use left arrow `<-` operator to assign a name to a returned value. `<-`
	cannot be used in the last action.
* A complete program is a big IO action. In a compiled program, this action is
	called `main` and has type `IO ()` - `IO` says that it does something with
	IO and `()` says that it has unit type, i.e., tuple with no elements
```
main = do
  putStrLn "The base?"
  x <- getLine
  putStrLn "The height?"
  y <- getLine
  let base = read x :: Double
  let height = read y :: Double
  putStrLn("The area of that triangle is " ++ show (0.5 * base * height))
```
# Look out for...
* `IO String` is different from `String` - `IO String` represents an action that
	will *give* a `String` when it's run. However, it *must* actually be run
	using the left arrow `<-` operator to get the `String` from `IO String`
* Converse too - using non-actions where actions are expected. Use `return` to
	cast `t` to `IO t`
