# Numeric recursion
* Function application binds more tightly than anything else
* Always list multiple function definitions starting with the most specific and
	proceeding to the most general
# List recursion
* Tip: base case usually involves an empty list, and the recursive case involves
	passing the tail of the list to the function again
