* Defining functions with no argument variables is called *point-free* style
```
multiplyList Integer -> [Integer] -> [Integer]
-- multiplyList definition --

doubleList [Integer] -> [Integer]
doubleList = multiplyList 2
```
* Right arrow operator (`->`) is right associative, i.e.
```
a -> b -> c = a -> (b -> c) (and not (a -> b) -> c)
```
* *Currying* - creating intermediate functions when feeding arguments into a
	complex function
# `map` function
* Prelude has `map` which takes two arguments - a unary function and a list; it
	applies the function to every element of the list
# Dot Dot Notation
* Syntax: `[<first>, <second> .. <last>]`
```
[1..10] == [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[2,4..10] == [2,4,6,8,10]
[5,4..1] == [5,4,3,2,1]
[1,3..10] = [1,3,5,7,9]
```
# Infinite Lists
```
[1..]
evens = map ((*) 2) [1..]
```
# On head and tail
* `:` is preferable over `head` and `tail` while splitting `List`s (as `head`
	and `tail` fail on empty lists)
* `null :: [a] -> Bool` can be used to check if a given `List` is empty
* `last` and `init` return the last element and a `List` with its last element
	removed (complements of `head` and `tail`). However, they also blow up with
	empty `List`s.
