# Folds
* Like `map`, a `fold` is a higher order function that takes a function and a
	list and uses the function to combine the elements of the list. For example
```
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat [] = []
concat (x : xs) = x ++ concat xs
```
* Prelude defines four fold functions: `foldr`, `foldl`, `foldr1` and `foldl1`
## `foldr`
* `foldr` folds up a list from right to left. Syntax:
```
foldr <binary operator> <initial accumulator> <list>
```
* `foldr` simply replaces `:` from the `List` definition with the function while
	replacing the empty list at then end with `acc`
```
foldr f acc (a:b:c:[]) = f a (f b (f c acc)) -- note the right nesting
```
* Mnemonic - rightmost operator accumulator
## `foldl`
* `foldl` folds up a list from left to right. Syntax:
```
foldl <binary operator> <initial accumulator> <list>
```
* `foldr` simply replaces `:` from the `List` definition with the function while
	replacing the empty list at then end with `acc`
```
foldl f acc (a:b:c:[]) = f (f (f acc a) b) c
```
* `foldl` is tail recursive - i.e. it recurses immediately but Haskell is also
	lazy, so recursions are not evaluated unless they will be needed. However,
	Haskell also has `foldl'` (fold l tick) which is strict.
* Mnemonic - accumulator operator leftmost
* Rule of thumb - use `foldr` if the list might be infinite. Use `foldl'` only
  when it is known that the list is finite.
## `foldr1`
* Works like `foldr` but instead of explicit accumulator, uses last element of
	list.
## `foldl1`
* Works like `foldl` but instead of explicit accumulator, uses first element of
	list.
# Lambda `\`
* Syntax: `\ <arg-list> -> <body>`
