Haskell has three ways to declare a new type
* `data` declaration, used to define new data types
* `type` declaration, used to create type synonym
* `newtype` declaration, used to define new data types equivalent to existing
	ones
# `data` and constructor functions
```
data Anniversary = Birthday String Int Int Int			-- name, year, month, day
				 | Wedding String String Int Int Int	-- spouse name 1, spouse name 2, year, month, day
```
* Types defined by `data` declarations are referred to as *algebraic data types*
* Type names and constructor functions must start with capital letters
* Constructors are called using their names
```
johnSmith :: Anniversary
johnSmith = Birthday "John Smith" 1968 7 3

smithWedding :: Anniversary
smithWedding = Wedding "John Smith" "Jane Smith" 1987 3 4

anniversariesOfJohnSmith :: [Anniversary]
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [johnSmith, smithWedding]
```
# Deconstructing types
```
showDate :: Int -> Int -> Int -> String
showDate y m d = show y ++ "-" ++ show m ++ "-" ++ show d

showAnniversary :: Aniversary -> String

showAnniversary (Birthday name year month day) =
	name ++ "born "" showDate year month day

showAnniversary (Wedding name1 name2 year month day) =
	name1 ++ " married " ++ name2 ++ " on " ++ showDate year month day
```
# `type` for making type synonyms
```
type Name = String
```
