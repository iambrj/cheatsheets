* In pattern matching, we attempt to match values against patterns and, if so
	desired, bind variables to successful matches
* Pattern matching gives us a way to
	- Recognize values (base case of recursion `[]`)
	- Bind variables (recursive case `(x:xs)`)
	- Break down values into parts (recursive case `(x:xs)`)
* Only functions allowed in pattern matching are *constructors* - functions used
	to build algebraic data types
# As-patterns
* As-patterns are a form of `var@pattern` and bind the name `var` to the whole
	value being matched by `pattern`
```
contrivedMap :: ([a] -> a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
contrivedMap f [] = []
contrivedMap f list@(x:xs) = f list x : contrivedMap f xs
```
# Records
* For constructors with many elements, *records* provide a way of naming values
	in a datatype using the following syntax
```
data Foo2 = Bar2 | Baz2 {bazNumber :: Int, bazName :: String}
h :: Foo2 -> Int
h Baz2 {bazName=name} = length name
h Bar2 {} = 0
x = Baz2 1 "Haskell"
y = Baz2 {bazName = "Curry", bazNumber = 2}
h x -- 7
h y -- 5
```
# Pattern matching applications
* Gist - *wherever you can bind variables*
* Equations
* Lambdas
* List comprehensions
* `do` blocks
