* In Haskell, `if` is an expression (which is converted to a value) and not a
  statement (which is executed) as in many imperative languages.
* Multiline `if` expressions are indented by aligning `else`s with `then`s,
	rather than with `if`s
```
describeLetter :: Char -> String
describeLetter c =
	if c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'
		then "Lower case"
		else if c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z'
			then "Upper case"
			else "Not ASCII letter"
```
* `case` expressions are to piece-wise function definitions what `if`
	expressions are to guards
```
f 0 = 18
f 1 = 15
f 2 = 12
f x = 12 - x
```
This is equivalent to (and in fact syntactic sugar for)
```
f x =
	case x of
		0 -> 18
		1 -> 15
		2 -> 12
		_ -> 12 - x
```
* Left hand side of any case branch is just a pattern, it can also be used for
	binding
```
describeString :: String -> String
describeString str =
	case str of
		(x:xs) -> "First char = " ++ [x]
		[]	   -> "Empty string"
```
* `case` expressions can be embedded anywhere another expression would fit
