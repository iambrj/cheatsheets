* `let ... in` construct is an expression, but `where` clauses are guards
* `where` clauses *can* incorporated into `case` expressions, even though they
	are not full expressions
```
describeColour c =
	"This colour "
	++ case c of
		Black -> "is black"
		White -> "is white"
		RGB red green blue -> " has an average of the components of " ++ show
av
			where av = (red + green + blue) `div` 3 -- note indent scopes to RGB
	++ ", yeah?"
```
* New operators can be defined in the usual way as other functions - just don't
	use any alphanumeric characters in their names
```
{- New operator to find the set difference -}
(\\) :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
xs \\ ys = foldl (\ zs y -> delete y zs) xs ys
```
* To use functions in infix form, surround their names with backticks
```
elem 1 [1..4]
1 `elem` [1..4]
```
