* Quicksort
```
quickSort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]

quickSort [] = []

quickSort (x : xs) = (quickSort less) ++ (x : equal) ++ (quickSort more)
	where
		less = filter (< x) xs
		equal = filter (== x) xs
		more = filter (> x) xs
```
* Quicksort using custom comparison function
```
quickSort' :: (Ord a) => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]

quickSort' _ [] = []

quickSort' c (x:xs) = (quickSort' c less) ++ (x : equal) ++ (quickSort' c more)
	where
		less = filter (\ y -> y `c` x == LT) xs
		equal = filter (\ y -> y `c` x == EQ) xs
		more = filter (\ y -> y `c` x == GT) xs
```
* `flip` - takes a function of two arguments and returns a version of the same
	function with arguments swapped
* `$` - takes a function and applies it to its second argument
* `uncurry` - takes a function of two arguments and returns a function that
	takes a pair as its only argument
* `curry` - takes a function that takes a pair as an argument and returns a
	curried function
* `id` - identity function, returns its argument unchanged
* `const` - takes two arguments, discards the second and returns the first
