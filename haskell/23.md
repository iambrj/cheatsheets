# Golden rule
* **Code which is part of some expression should be indented further in than the
	beginning of that expression**
* All *grouped* expressions must be exactly aligned
* Use bracket and semi-colon instead of indents
```
foo :: Double -> Double
foo x =
  let s = sin x
      c = cos x
  in 2 * s * c

foo :: Double -> Double
foo x = let {
  s = sin x;
  c = cos x;
} in 2 * s * c
```
