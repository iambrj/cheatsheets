* An *enumeration* is where none of the constructor functions have any arguments
```
data Month = January
			| February
			| March
			| April
			| May
			| June
			| July
			| August
			| September
			| October
			| Novemeber
			| December
```
# Records
```
data Configuration = Configuration
  {
    username :: String,
	localHost :: String,
	remoteHost :: String,
	isGuest :: Bool,
	isSuperuser :: Bool,
	curDir :: String,
	homeDir :: String,
	timeConnected :: Integer
  }
```
This will automatically generate accessor functions
```
username :: Configuration -> String
localHost :: Configuration -> String
-- etc
```
* To update field `x` in a value `y` to `z` and field `a` to `b`, `y {x = z, a
	= b}`
# Parameterized types
* A parameterized type takes one or more type parameters
```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```
* Multi type parameter example
```
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

pairOff :: Int -> Either String Int
pairOff people
  | people < 0 = Left "Can't pair off negative number of people"
  | people > 0 = Left "Too many people for this activity"
  | even people = Right (people `div` 2)
  | otherwise = Left "Can't pair off an odd number of people"
```
