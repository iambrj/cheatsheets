* The point of type classes is to ensure that certain operations will be
	available for values of chosen types
* To create a type class, use the `class` keyword
```
class Eq a where
  (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  x /= y = not (x == y)
  x == y = not (x /= y)
```
* To make a type instance, use the `instance` keyword
```
data Foo =  Foo {x :: Integer, str :: String}

instanct Eq Foo where
  (Foo x1 str1) == (Foo x2 str2) = (x1 = x2) && (str1 == str2)
```
* Type synonyms defined with `type` keyword cannot be made instances of a class
# Deriving
```
data Foo = Foo {x :: Integer, str :: String}
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```
`deriving` can be used with
|    class    |    description    |
|    -----    |    -----------    |
|     `Eq`    | `==` and `/=`     |
|    `Ord`    | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `min`, `max`, `compare` |
|    `Enum`   | (for enumerations only) allows use of list syntax `[Blue..Green]`  |
|  `Bounded`  | (for enumerations only) provides `minBound` and `maxBound` as the lowest and highest values that the type can take 
|   `Show`    | defines `show`, converts value to a string  |
|   `Read`    | defines `read`, parses string into value   |
# Class inheritance
* Use `=>` to indicate inheritance
```
class (Eq a) => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
  (<), (<=), (>=), (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
  max, min  :: a -> a -> a
```
* Use comma separated list to indicate multiple inheritance
```
class (Num a, Ord a) => Real a where
  toRational :: a -> Rational
```
# Type constraints
```
foo :: (Num a, Show a, Show b) => a -> a -> b -> String
foo x y t =
  show x ++ " plus " ++ show y ++ " is " ++ show (x + y) ++ ". " ++ show t
```
# Example
```
class Located a where
  getLoaction :: a -> (Int, Int)

class (Located a) => Moveable a where
  setLocation :: (Int, Int) -> a -> a

data NamedPoint = NamedPoint
  {
  pointName :: String,
  pointX :: Int,
  pointY :: Int
  } deriving (Show)

instance Located NamedPoint where
  getLocation p = (pointX p, pointY p)

instance Movable NamedPoint where
  setLocation (x, y) p = p { pointX = x, pointY = y }

move :: (Movable a) => (Int, Int) -> a -> a
move (dx, dy) p = setLocation (x + dx, y + dy) p
  where
  (x, y) = getLocation p
```
