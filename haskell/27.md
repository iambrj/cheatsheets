* `Functor` is Prelude class for types which can be mapped over. It has a single
	method called `fmap`
```
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap f Nothing = Nothing
  fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
```
# Intuition
* Functor is a container (list, tree, set etc) of elements of type `a`
* `fmap` takes a function that maps elements of type `a` to elements of type `b`
	and applies this function to every element of a functor of elements of type
	`a`, thus returning a functor of elements of type `b`
* `fmap` is a generalization of `map` for any parametrized data type
# Laws
1. Identity
```
fmap id = id
```
2. Function distribution
```
fmap (f . g) = (fmap f) . (fmap g)
```
