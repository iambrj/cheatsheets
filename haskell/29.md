# Prologue: IO, an applicative functor
```
readMaybe :: Read a => String -> Maybe a
```
* It provides a simple way of converting strings into Haskell values
```
readMaybe "3" :: Maybe Integer
> Just 3
readMaybe "foo" :: Maybe Integer
> Nothing
readMaybe "3.5" :: Maybe Integer
> Nothing
readMaybe "3.5" :: Maybe Double
Just 3.5
```
* Example - interactive doubling
```
import Text.Read

interactiveDoubling = do
    putStrLn "Choose a number:"
    s <- getLine
    let mx = readMaybe s :: Maybe Double
    case fmap (2*) mx of
        Just x -> putStrLn ("The double of your number is " ++ show x)
        Nothing -> do
            putStrLn "This is not a valid number. Retrying..."
            interactiveDoubling
```
* We would like to do something like
 ```
 case somehowSumMaybes mx my of
  Just z -> putStrLn("The sum of your numbers is " ++ show z)
  Nothing -> do
    putStrLn "Invalid number. Retrying..."
    interactiveSumming
 ```
 `somehowSumMaybes` turns out to be `<*>`
```
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```
# Intuition
* What happens when we try to combine wrapped data?
* An applicative functor is a functor which supports applying functions within
    the functor
* The `Applicative` instance for `Maybe` is
```
instance Applicative Maybe where
  pure  =  Just
  (Just f) <*> (Just x) = (Just f x)
  _ <*> _ = Nothing
```
* `pure`takes a value and brings it into the functor in a default, trivial way
* All expressions in Haskell are *referentially transparent* - we can replace
	any expression whatsoever by its value without changing the behaviour of the
	program
* `<$>` when applied to lists applies every function from first list to every
    element of second list
# Applicative IO
* Consider the following
```
main = putStrLn (addExclamation getLine)
```
Now, if `getLine` is a `String`, which `String` is it? It could be anything the
user chooses to type at the terminal, and yet, replacing `getLine` by any
`String` breaks the program as the user would not be able to type the input
string at the terminal any longer. Therefore `getLine` having type `String`
would cause referential transparency to be broken. In general, results of I/O
operations are *opaque* - it is impossible to tell them in advance as they
depend on factors external to the program
* `IO` type constructor is used to achieve referential transparency here -
    `getLine` being an `IO String` means that it is not any actual `String`, but
    both a placeholder for a `String` that will only materialize when the
    program is executed and a promise that this String will indeed be delivered
* `<*>` maintains a consistent order of execution between the actions it
    combines
```
putStrLn "Enter two strings"
sz <- (++) <$> getLine <*> getLine
```
* `*>` can be used to execute in sequence (like a `do` block)
