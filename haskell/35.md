# Notes on state monad

* Intuition: Perform stateful computation and return value with new state
* Definition:

```
-- s is type of state and a is type of result
newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -> (a,s) }
instance Monad (State s) where
    return x = state (\s -> (x,s))
    p >>= q = state (\s -> let (val, newState) = runState p s
                                b = q val
                            in  runState b newState)

```

* Example:

```
import Control.Monad.State

pop :: State Stack Int
pop = state $ \(x:xs) -> (x,xs)

push :: Int -> State Stack ()
push a = state $ \xs -> ((),a:xs)
```
