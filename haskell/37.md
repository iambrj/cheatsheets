# Monad transformers
* Key idea - combine functionalities provided by different monads into a single
    monad
* Example
```
newtype MaybeTransformer m a = MaybeTransformer { runMaybeTrans :: m (Maybe a) }

instance Monad m => Monad (MaybeTransformer m) where
  return = MaybeTransformer . return . Just

  x >>= f = MaybeTransformer $ do maybe_val <- runMaybeTrans x
                                  case maybe_val of
                                    Nothing -> return Nothing
                                    Just value -> runMaybeTrans $ f value

getPassword :: MaybeTransformer IO String
getPassword = do s <- lift getLine
                guard (isValid s)
                return s

askPassword :: MaybeTransformer IO ()
askPassword = do lift $ putStrLn "Enter new password: "
                value <- msum $ repeat getPassword
                lift $ putStrLn "Saving in db"
```

# Lifting
* Key idea - lift/bring/promote base monad computation into combined monad
    computation
