# Lists
* Square brackets delimit the list, and individual elements are separated by
	commas. All elements of a list must be of the same type.
```
let numbers = [1,2,3,4]
```
## Consing
* Lists can be built up piece by piece using the `:` operator (cons, from LISP).
	Syntax:`something:someList`. It evaluates from right to left. Haskell builds
	all lists this way, `[]` is syntactic sugar. Lists cannot be consed onto an
	element.
```
let numbers = [1,2,3,4]
0:numbers
>> [0,1,2,3,4]
```
* Strings are just `List`s of characters. `" "` notation is just syntactic sugar
	for multiple `:` operators.
* Use the `++` operator to concatenate two `List`s
```
[1,2] ++ [3,4]
>> [1,2,3,4]
```
# Tuple
* Tuples are marked by `()` and delimited by `,`
* Tuples cannot be consed - they are immutable
```
(1, "Bharath", True)
```
# Retrieving
* Use `fst` to get first element of a pair.
* Use `snd` to get second element of a pair.
* Use `head` to get first element of a list.
* Use `tail` to get rest of the list.
* `head` and `tail` __crash__ on empty lists.
* Rule of thumb: avoid functions that might fail without warning.
