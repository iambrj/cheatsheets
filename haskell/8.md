# Function composition
* Function composition is applying one function to a value and then applying
	another function to the result.
* Functions can be composed using the `.` - function composition operator
```
squareOfF x = (square . f) x
fOfSquare x = (f . square) x
```
# Prelude and the libraries
* Prelude is the core library loaded by default in every every Haskell program.
* Use `import` keyword to import modules into current program.
## Prelude functions for `String`s
* `words` - breaks down a string in whitespace delimited words, returning a list
	of `String`s
* `reverse` - reverses a list
* `unwords` - does opposite of words
