# `if ... then ... else`
* Both `then` and `else` clauses are required, furthermore both of them should
	evaluate to the same type
```
mySignum x =
 if x < 0
  then -1
   else if x > 0
    then 1
	else 0
```
# Pattern matching
## Piece-wise definition
```
pts :: Int -> Int
pts 1 = 10
pts 2 = 6
pts 3 = 4
pts 4 = 3
pts 5 = 2
pts 6 = 1
pts _ = 0 -- Note use of _ wildcard --
```
## Things to watch out for
* Shadowing - patterns for specific matches should come before general ones
* Have patterns to cover all cases - like `otherwise` with gaurds
* Use pattern matching to extract elements from tuples
```
fst' :: (a, b) -> a
fst' (x, _) = x
snd' :: (a, b) -> b
snd`(_, x) = x
```
and lists
```
head' :: [a] -> a
head' (x:_) = x
head' [] = error "Prelude.head: empty list"
tail' :: [a] -> [a]
tail' (_:x) = x
tail[] = error "Prelude.tail: empty list"
```
# `let` binding
* Syntax: `let <var> = <expr> in <expr>`
