HTTP client and server communicate by sending text messages.

An HTTP message consists of a message header and an optional message body,
separated by a blank line.

# HTTP request message syntax
```
<Request Line>    ----|
                      |- Request Message Header
<Request Headers>  ---|
<Request Message Body>
```

## Request line syntax
```
request-method-name request-URI HTTP-version
```
where
* `request-method-name`: are a set of request methods (GET, POST, HEAD etc)
  defined by the HTTP protocol
* `request-URI`: specifies the resource requested
* `HTTP-version`: specifies the verison of protocol used

Example for request line is `GET /test.html HTTP/1.1`

## Request headers syntax
The request headers are in the form of `name:value` pairs. Multiple values are
comma separated
```
request-header-name: request-header-value1, request-header-value2, ...
```
Example
```
Host: www.google.com
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept: image/gif
```

# HTTP response message syntax
```
<Response Message Header>
<Separated by a blank line>
<Response Message Body>
```

## Status line syntax:
```
HTTP-version status-code reason-phrase
```
where
* `HTTP-version`: HTTP version used in this session
* `status-code`: 3-digit number generated by server to reflet outcome of reqeust
* `reason-phrase`: gives a short explanation to the status code

## Response header syntax
Response headers are `name:value` pairs
```
response-header-name: response-header-value1, response-header-value2, ...
```
Example
```
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 35
Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
```
## "GET" request method
Clients use GET request methods to request for a piece of resource

Syntax:-
```
GET request-URI HTTP-version
(optional request headers)
(blank line)
(optional request body)
```
where
* GET is case sensitive and must be in uppercase
* request-URI specifies the path of resource requested, which must begin from
the root "/" of the document base directory
* HTTP-version specifies version of HTTP being used
* The client uses optional request headers (Accept, Accept-Language etc)
* optional request body contains the query string

## Response status codes
|		Code		|		Meaning		|
|		----		|		-------		|
| 1xx (Informational) | Request received, server is continuing the process |
| 2xx (Success)		| Request successfully received, understood, accepted and serviced |
| 3xx (Redirection)	| Further action must be taken to complete the request |
| 4xx (Client error) | Request contains bad syntax or cannot be understood |
| 5xx (Server error) | Server failed to fulfill an apparently valid reqeust | 

## HTTP/1.1 GET request
HTTP/1.1 server supports virtual hosts - multiple hosts on the same server each
with their own root directory. Thus, a HTTP/1.1 GET request need a request
header called "Host" to select one of the virtual hosts.

## Conditional GET requests
* If-Modified-Since
* If-Unmodified-Since
* If-Match
* If-None-Match
* If-Range

## Request headers
* Host: domain-name
* Accept: mime-type-1, mime-type-2, ...
* Accept-Language: lang-1, lang-2, ...
* Accept-Charset: Charset-1, Charset-2, ...
* Accept-Encoding: encoding-method-1, encoding-method-2, ...
* Connection: Close|Keep-Alive
* Referer: referer-URL
* User-Agent: browser-type
* Content-Length: number-of-bytes
* Cache-Control: no-cache|...
* Authorization: used by client to supply its credential
* Cookie: cookie-name-1, cookie-name-2, ...
* If-Modified-Since: date

## GET for Directory
If a client issues a GET request to "/testdir/"
1. The server will return "/testdir/index.html" if it exists
2. Otherwise, the server returns the directory listing, if directory listing is
   enabled in the server configuration
3. Otherwise, the server returns "404 Page Not Found"

If the trailing '/' is not specified (i.e. request is for "/testdir" and not
"/testdir/"), the server requests an additional GET command with "301 Move
Permanently" with new "Location" as "/testdir/"

# HEAD Request Method
HEAD is like GET, but server returns only the header and not the actual document
Syntax:
```
HEAD request-URI HTTP-version
(other optional request headers)
(blank line)
(optional request body)
```

# OPTIONS Request Method
OPTIONS is used to query the server which request methods are supported
Syntax:
```
OPTIONS request-URI|* HTTP-version
(other optional headers)
(blank line)
```

# TRACE Request Method
TRACE is used to ask the server to return a diagnostic trace
```
TRACE / HTTP-version
(blank line)
```

# POST Request Method
POST request method is used to "additional" data up to the server
Syntax:
```
POST request-URI HTTP-version
Content-Type: mime-type
Content-Length: number-of-bytes
(other optional request headers)

(URL-encoded query string)
```
