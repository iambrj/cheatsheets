# Guidelines to reading

- Pay attention to evolution of Dakhni
- Read critically

- nastaliq - hanging style calligraphy
- Urdu literature has close connections to Persian heritage, due to Turco-Mongolian immigrants
- Poetry mostly developed in courts of rulers in Muslim India, as in Iran. Poets
    imitated Iran genres, including
    1. Monorhymes/Qasidas : all the lines have the same end rhyme. Used to sing
       about course personalities, prophets, saints
        It came in a winterâ€™s night,
        a fierce cold with quite a bite.
        Frosted wind with all its might
        sent ice and snow an invite
        to layer earth in pure white
        and glisten with morning light.
    2. Mathnawi : romantic narratives about heroic adventures, amorous legends.
       Usually 11, rarely 10 meter couplets. No limit on couplets
    3. Rubai : 4 line poem with lyrical/philosophical contents
    4. Ghazals : 5-15 couplet poem, all couplets have same rhyming pattern and
       same meter, written for their own pleasure
    5. Qitas
    6. Tarih
