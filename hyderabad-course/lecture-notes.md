- Dakhni, Hyderabadi, and Urdu
- Rekhta.org, Rekhta : early name for literary version and specific genres in
    this langauge, mixture of Persian and Indian languages
- Dakhni dies out after Bijapur loss

## Questions

- The kind of language they speak in Old City

- Books on court life of Qutb Shahs
- Why is it called Hussain Sagar?
- How to "verify" history?
    Court chronicles, (not Firishta), multidisciplinary approach history, look at
    inscriptions, look at coins, depend heavily on written sources. Look at a
    variety of sources/evidence and asses on based on that. Legend of Bhagmati
