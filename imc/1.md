- Private-key encryption scheme: all parties share a *key* which allows them to
    encrypt and decrypt thus restricting others from access. Note that there is
    only one key for both operations.
- Public-key encryption scheme: two keys - private & public - used to encrypt
    and decrypt
- A private key encryption scheme is defined by specifying
    1. A message space $\mathcal{M}$: the set of messages supported by the
       scheme
    2. A procedure for generating keys, `Gen`: probabilistically outputs keys
       according to some chosen distribution
    3. A procedure for encrypting, `Enc`: `Enc`$_k(m)$ takes key $k$, message
       $m$ and outputs ciphertext $c$
    4. A procedure for decrypting, `Dec`: `Dec`$_k(c)$ takes key $k$, ciphertext
       $c$ and outputs plaintext $m$
    with the requirement that
    \begin{gather*}
        \textrm{\Verb+Dec+}_k(\textrm{\Verb+Enc+}_k(m)) = m, \forall m\in\mathcal{M}
    \end{gather*}
- The set of all possible keys generated by `Gen` is called the *key space*,
    denoted by $\mathcal{K}$. WIG, it can be assumed that `Gen` chooses
    uniformly from $\mathcal{K}$.
- Kerckhoff's principle: The cipher method must not be required to be secret,
    and it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without
    inconvenience.
    The motivation behind this is to design schemes whose security relies solely
    on the secrecy of the key. Arguments in favor
    1. Easier to ensure secrecy of key than algorithm
    2. Easier to replace key than algorithm
    3. Easier for everybody to rely on same algorithm on large scale
- Caeser's cipher: shift Latin alphabet by 3
- Shift cipher: generalization of Caeser's cipher, shift by something from [0,
    25]
- Brute-force/Exhaustive-search attack: attack involving trying every possible
    key
- Sufficient key-space principle; Any secure encryption scheme must have a key
    space that is sufficiently large to make an exhaustive-search attack
    infeasible.
    By today's standards, that means a key space size of at least $2^{70}$
- Mono-alphabetic encryption: Bijection between permutations of same alphabet
    set.
    Although key space is quite large (~$2^{88}$), statistical patterns from
    language use can be used to break this scheme
- The Vigenere/poly-alphabetic shift cipher: Smoothens out frequency
    distribution of characters in the ciphertext making it harder to perform
    statistical analysis
- Principles behind modern cryptography
    1. Formal definitions; If you don't understand what you want to achieve, how
       can you possibly know when/if you have achieved it?
       - guide design of schemes
       - evaluate and analyze what is constructed
       - enable meaningful comparison of schemes
       - enable secure usage of schemes
       - promotes modularity
    Threat models
       - Cipher-text only attack
       - Known-plaintext attack
       - Chosen-plaintext attack
       - Chosen-ciphertext attack
    2. Precise assumptions
       - validate assumptions
       - compare schemes
       - understand necessary assumptions
    3. Proofs of Security: iron clad guarantee that no attacker will succeed
