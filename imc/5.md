- Collision resistance: hard for PPT adversary to find collision in $H$
\begin{gather*}
Pr[Hash-coll_{A, \pi} = 1]\leq negl(n)
\end{gather*}
- Merkle-Damagard transform : compression by a single bit is as easy/hard as
    compressing by an arbitrary amount
    \begin{enumerate}
    (Gen, h : 2n\rightarrow n)
    \item Parse string of length $L$ into $B$ blocks
    \item set $z_0 = 0^n$
    \item For $i\in [1, B+1]$, set $z_i = h(z_{i-1}||x_i)$
    \item Output $z_{B+1}$
    \end{enumerate}
- Hash MAC
