- For naturals $a$ and $b$, the smallest value $aX+bY$ can take is their gcd
- $b$ is invertible modulo $N$ iff they are coprime
- If $N = \Pi_i p_i^{e_i}$, then $\phi(N) = \Pi_i p_i^{e_i-1}(p_i-1)$
- Factoring problem: Given a composite number $N$, find numbers $p$ and $q$ such
    that $p\times q = N$. No polynomial time algorithms known. Exponential
    $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}.||N||^c)$.
- If $H$ is a nontrivial subgroup of $G$, then $|H|\leq |G|/2$
- If there exists a witness that $N$ is composite, then at least half the
  elements of $\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ are witnesses that $N$ is composite.
- $a$ is a strong witness for $N$'s compositness, if
  1. $a^u\neq\pm 1 mod N$
  1. $a^{2^i}u\neq-1 mod N$
- If $N$ is an odd number that is not a prime power, then at least half the
    elements of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ are strong witnesses that $N$ is composite.
