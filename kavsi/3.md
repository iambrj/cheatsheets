# Rationalism and Empiricism

## The Rationalism of Rene Descartes

1. Demolish all previous opinions
2. Know for certainty that I, a thinking being, exist, irrespective of everything else
3. A clear and distinct perception of what I was asserting
4. All mistakes arise from our freedom

## The Empiricism of John Locke

- Outer experiences + inner thought
- Knowledge: the perception of the connection and agreement, or disagreement and
    repugnancy, of any of our ideas
- Demonstrative knowledge: knowledge that a mind sees through a chain of
    connecting ideas
- Sensitive knowledge: connected to existence of things being experienced:
    clothes worn. Different from recollection
- Judgement allows us to hold that something is probably true, and probably is
    good enough
