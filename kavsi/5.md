# Internalism and externalism

## The first-person point of view

- Internalist: You can't know something unless you can see for yourself why you believe it
- Externalist: Knowledge is a relationship between the knower and the fact.
    Internalism leads to scepticism.

## Nozick's tracking theory

- Having the tendency to believing something when it is true, and not believing
    when it is not is knowing
$S$ knows that $p$ iff
1. $p$ is true
2. $S$ believes that $p$
3. If $p$ were not true, $S$ would not believe that $p$
4. If $p$ were true, $S$ would believe that $p$

In other words, the belief formation mechanism should be such that it should
actually track the truthfulness of beliefs.

## The Generality Problem

- Which belief forming process is relevant for justification determining
  purposes?

## Questionable methods
