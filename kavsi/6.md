# Testimony

## They told you so

- Testimony allows us to "know" things which we otherwise could not have

## No way to know

- Testimony: someone telling something which plays a key role in what you get
    out of the exchange
- One believing something based on a testimony is to understand what is being
    told and taking it for granted
- Locke's argument: at best, it is highly probable that a testimony is true. Key
    problem lies here is people's reliance on their past experiences
- Locke's formula for confidence of a testimony (along with one's experiences)
    1. The number of witnesses
    2. Their integrity
    3. Their skill
    4. The purpose they have in supplying their report
    5. The internal consistency of what is conveyed, and the circumstances of
       your hearing it
    6. Whether there is any contrary testimony
- This allows for future questioning of current knowledge
- Locke does **not** show: difference between knowledge providing powers of
    perception and testimony

## The middle ground: reductionism

- Use ordinary powers of inference to make judgements about testimonies
- Global reductionism: rely on experiences to make judgements
- Local reductionism: look for specific positive reasons in any given situation

## Testimony as a distinctive source of knowledge

- Craig's argument: knowledge as a consequence of testimony
- Knowers: good informants. Counter: knowers can be deceptive
- Failures: Gettier case victims
