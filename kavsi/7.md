# Shifting standards?

## Counting on context

- As words themselves have wildly different meanings (I, here, small/big,
    tomorrow), what about "to know"?
- Contextualism: knowing itself is context sensitive

## The emergence of contextualism

- Relevant Alternatives: shift the burden of proof & knowing goes hand in hand
  with grasping a contrast
- Closure: anything that is logically deducible from what is already known is
  also known
- Relevant Alternatives denies closure: zebra & painted donkey example
- Contextualism uses Relevant Alternatives with closure as follows
    1. Standards for knowledge varies with setting (think street, school, court)
    2. Employ one, and only one, set of standards for knowledge in any given
       setting
- Contextualism is just skepticism in disguise? No, both (skeptic argument and
  non-skeptic argument) true according to contextualism. It's like asking which
  weekday is ultimately 'tomorrow'
- Active question: why is context sensitive nature of language obscured when
  talking about knowledge?

## Interest-relative invariantism

- Interest-relative invariantism: practical interest play a role
- IRI is beyond Contextualism - it is a theory of how knowledge itself works,
  not just semantics
- More evidence is needed for knowledge as the stakes rise

## Old-fashioned invariantism, again?

- IRI cannot handle shifting intuitions patterns
- IRI cannot handle counterfactual possibilities
- Moderate Strict Invariantism: there is a single fixed standard that must be
  met for knowledge, and humans frequently meet it (unlike skepticism)
