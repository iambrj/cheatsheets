# Knowing about knowing

## Epistemology's raw materials

## Reading minds

- Human beings can not only keep track of what other human beings know/not know,
  but also know _where_ other human beings are mistaken (latter not observed in
  any other species). They are able to calculate other people's false beliefs
- Above notions go well with knowledge first approach
- Natural limits on mindreading
    * Limit on recursion
    * Tendency to be self centered - egocentrism (children crayon candybox).
        It's tough to suppress our own private knowledge when calculating how
        well someone else might perform 

## Challenges to the case method

- Experimental philosophy advocated abandonment of reliance on intuitions for
  knowledge
- Theory starts clouding experiments when thinking too hard

## Impressions of knowledge, and knowledge itself
- Cummins' conclusion: philosophers should not rely on their intuitions for
    theorizing knowledge
- We do not yet understand the full nature of knowledge
