- A tick mark directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens is an `Atom`.
- Two expressions are the same `Atom` if their values are tick marks followed by
    identical letters and hyphens
- Forms of judgements
    1. _ is a _
    2. _ is the same _ as _
    3. _ is a type
    4. _ and _ are the same type
- `Atom` is a type
- Judgements are acts of knowing
- For each type, every expression described by that type has a **normal form**,
  the most direct way of writing it. Two expression are the same iff they have
  identical normal forms.
- It is meaningless to ask if expressions are same without specifying types,
  i.e. asking "is `(+ 1 2)` the same as `3`" is meaningless, asking "is
  `(+ 1 2)` the same `Nat` as 3" is meaningful.
- When defining a name, it is necessary to first `claim` the name with a type
```
(claim one
    Nat)
(define one
    (add1 zero))
```
- An expression is normal if its top is a **constructor** and the constructor's
  arguments are normal
- Any expression with a constructor at the top is called a **value**
- `add1` and `zero` are constructors that create **data**, but `Nat` and `Pair`
    are type constructors
