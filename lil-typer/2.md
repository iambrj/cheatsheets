- Eliminators take apart values built by constructors
- Applying a function to arguments is the eliminator for functions
- Expressions that aren't values and cannot yet be evaluated due to a variable
  are called **neutral**
- `which-Nat` discriminate between zero and other natural numbers and take
    appropriate action
```
(which-Nat target
    base
    step)
```
- An type expression is a type value if it has a type constructor at its top
    (similar to how an expression described by a type is value when it has a
    constructor at its top)
- Every $U$ is a type. But not every type is a $U$
- TODO: What is a type that is not a $U$?
