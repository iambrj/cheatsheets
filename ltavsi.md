# What is Theory?

- Fields of study that have effects outside the field
- A critique of common sense

## Foucault on sex

- Repressive Hypothesis: earlier periods repressed sex and moderns fought to
    liberate
- Theory: there was no liberation, but amalgamation of a wide range of
    anatomical, physical, social and psychological to give birth to the notion
    of sex
- Key characteristics of Foucault's theory analytical and speculative

1. Interdisciplinary
2. Analytical and speculative
3. Critique of common sense
4. Reflexive

# What is Literature and Does it Matter?

- Difficult to answer because
    1. Need to distinguish between literary and non-literary works
    2. Need to provide argument to study literature
    3. What does it provide

## Conventions of literature
- "Hyper-protected cooperative principle": readers assume the effort they put in
    to understand literature will be "worth it", i.e. they assume the writer is
    cooperating with them.

## The nature of literature

1. Literature as the foregrounding of language - forces unusual attention
2. Literature as the integration of language
3. Literature as fiction - the relationship between the work and the real world
   is up to interpretation
4. Literature as aesthetic object
5. Literature as intertextual or self-reflexive construct - to read something as
   literature is to consider it as a linguistic event that has meaning in
   relation to other discourses

## Functions of literature

- Historically, replacement for religion
- Literature is both an instrument to drive ideology and for its undoing


## Paradox of literature

- Literature effects itself
- Need to answer "what is literature" so that literary theorists can promote
    what they take to be the most pertinent critical methods and to dismiss
    methods that neglect the most basic and distinctive aspects of literature

# Literature and Cultural Studies

- Culture is an expression of the people and culture is an imposition on the
  people. Literature can therefore be studied to study a people and can also
  voice the oppressed.
- Why to study (i.e. arguments for literary theory) vs how to study (i.e.
  methods to employ in literary theory)

# Language, Meaning, and Interpretation

- Three levels of meaning
    1. Meaning of a word
    2. Meaning of an utterance
    3. Meaning of a text

## Saussure's theory of language

- A language is a system of differences
- "Its most precise characteristic is to be what the others are not"
- Sign = form (plane of sound) + meaning (plane of thought)
- Language is both the concrete manifestation of ideology (a framework for
    speakers to think in) and the site of its questioning/undoing

## Poetics vs hermeneutics

- Poetics : concerned with attested meanings/effects and how they are achieved
- Hermeneutics : concerned with texts and seek to discover better
    interpretations (think legal documents/sacred texts)

## Readers and meaning

- Literary work is a succession of actions upon the understanding of readers =>
    interpretation of work is a story of that encounter

### Meaning, intention, and context

- Meaning is given by the intent of the speaker
- Meaning is given by the language
- Meaning is given by the context
- Meaning is the experience of the reader
- "The Intentional Fallacy"
- It is simultaneously a property of the text and the experience of the subject
- Meaning is context bound, but context is boundless

# Rhetoric, Poetics, and Poetry

- Rhetoric : study of persuasive and expressive resources of the language -
    techniques to construct strong discourses
- Poetic : art of imitation/representation
- Language is fundamentally figurative and what is considered literal are those
    figures whose figurative nature has been forgotten
- Metaphor : links by means of similarity
- Metonymy : links by means of contiguity
- Synecdoche : substitution of part for whole ("ten hands" == "ten workers")
- Irony
- Poem is both a structure made of text and an event in literary history
- Three distinct figures associated with a poem
    1. The poet
    2. The narrator (important to distinguish from the poet)
    3. Image of the poetic voice emerging from study of multiple poems by the
       same poet
- Lyrical poetry is utterance overheard
- Productive way to analyze poems : what are the situations that lead to this
    specific utterance?
- Paradox of lyrical poetry : the sublime
- Prefixing with 'O' (as in 'O lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud') signifies
    the speaker embodying the spirit of poetry
- Frye's constituents of poem
    1. babble - exploiting non-semantic features of language (sound, rhythm,
       repeating letters etc) to produce charm
       ```
       This darksome burn, horseback brown,
       His rollrock highroad roaring down
       ```
   2. doodle - riddle the readers
       ```
       Pease porridge hot,
       Pease porridge cold,
       Pease porridge in the pot,
       Nine days old.
       ```
- Theories of poetry propose relations between semantic (what poems says) and
    non-semantic (how poem says) dimensions of language
- Poems are to be treated not as parts of conversation to be interpreted, rather
    an aesthetic whole/unity
- Russian Formalists : one level of structure of poem should mirror another
- Romantics, New Critics : analogy between poem and natural organisms, all parts
    should fit together harmoniously
- Post-structuralists : assert impossibility of poems practising what they
    preach
- Poetic imagination
