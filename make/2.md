A simple makefile looks like
```
target ... : prerequisites ...
	recipe
	...
	...
```
* `target` is the name of a file that is generated by a program
* `prerequisites` is a file that is used as input to create `target`
* `recipe` is an action that make carries out

Targets that do not refer to files but are just actions are called *phony
targets*.

By default `make` starts with the first target, called the *default goal*.

The recompilation is made based on time stamps of the prerequisites.

*Variables* allow text strings to be defined once and subsituted in multiple
places later.

A variable's value is subsituted by writing `$(varName)`

`make` has an *implicit rule* for updating the `.o` file from a correspondingly
named `.c` file using a `cc -c` command (option `-c` says not to run the linker).
