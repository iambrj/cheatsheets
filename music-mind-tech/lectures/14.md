- mel scale : starts at 1000 Hz
- Twice as high pitch gives twice as high mel value
- At higher frequencies larger and larger intervals needed to produce equal
    pitch increments
- pitch of harmonic tones approx = fundamental frequency
- pitch depends slightly on intensity
- two kinds of pitch
    + spectral
    + virtual
- pitch perception happens as a combination of
    + place coding : location of maximal oscillation along basilar membrane
    + rate coding : periodicity information encoded in neuron firing patterns
- Hearing sensitivity depends heavily on frequency
- Audio masking
    + Simultaneous masking : when both occur at same time and close in frequency
    + Temporal masking
- Timbre : miscellaneous category for describing psychological attributes of
    sounds left over after accounting for pitch, loudness and duration
    + Multidimensional
    + Complex with no agreed upon definition
    + Physically correlates to
        * Spectral, temporal envelope
- Auditory hallucinations
    + schizophrenia, mood disorders, AD
    + Transient (excess caffeine)
    + musical ear syndrome
- abnormal activation of normal auditory, language perception and production
    pathways
- Causes
    + sensory deprivation
    + social interaction deprivation
    + abuse/bullying/harassment
- Tinnitus
    + noises in the head not related to any psychiatric condition
    + causes : damage in ear nerves, infections, blood pressure, age related
    + treatment : sound therapy, noise markers
    + prevention : use ear protection
- Types of hearing loss
    + conductive hearing loss
    + sensory-neural hearing loss
- Levels of music processing
- Perceptual constancy
- Auditory scene analysis : location, distance
- Gestalt principles
    + Gestalt : shape or form
    + 1890s : Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler
    + reaction to atomism
    + holistic/gestalt : who is something else than the sum of its parts
- Principle of Continuity : humans have a preference for continuous colors
- Principle of Closure : closed entities
- Figure-Ground
- Principle of Common Fate
- Auditory scene analysis
