- How to go from signals to concepts
- Levels of music processing
    + Concepts : mood, style, emotion, from, tension, similarity
    + Structures : melody, harmony, tonality, scale, meter
    + Features : streams, segments, dissonance, chords, dynamics, pulse, pitch,
        duration, timbre, loudness, location
    + Signal : audio
- Structure to meaning, syntax to semantics
- Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
- Musicological motivation
    + Traditional music analysis : non-falsifiable theories, small corpora, based
        on personal/intuitive ideas
    + Computational music analysis
- MIR applications
    + Recommendation
    + Playlist generation
    + Summarization
    + Content-based music search
    + Automatic music transcription
- Matlab's MIR Toolbox
- Audio
    + Audio signals represents the air pressure variations that constitute sound
    + Digital audio signal : sampled representation of analog audio signal
- Two ways to represent sound signal
    + Time domain : signal waveform
    + Frequency domain : spectrum
- Time domain representation : variation of sound amplitude as a function of
    time
    + Temporal features : attack time, amplitude envelope
    + Periodicity
    + Different time domain representation may sound similar
    + Irrelevant perceptually relevant
- Frequency domain representation : reprensting wave form as amplitude/phases of
    the individual frequency components vs frequency
    + Use transformation : Fourier, Wavelet
    + Fourier idea : any sound signal can be represented as a sum of various
      sine waves. They vary in
      * Frequency (What)
      * Amplitude (How much)
      * Phase (When)
    + Fourier transform : Time -> frequency domain
- Sampling : discretization of continuous waves
- Aliasing : loss of information for frequencies above Nyquist frequencey
- Nyquist Theorem : for given sample rate fs, perfect reconstruction is
    guaranteed possible for a bandlimit $B < \frac{fs}{2}$
- Nyquist frequencey = $f_s/2$
- FFT not meaningful for long since it does not capture temporal evolution.
    Solution : short-time fourier transform
    + Segmented
    + Overlapping segments
