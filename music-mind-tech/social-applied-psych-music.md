# Musical preference and taste

## The music

- Experimental aesthetics : an attempt at producing laws governing responses to
    all forms of art
- Plus points of this field
    + Precise control of music stimuli
    + Precise control over circumstances under which music is played
    + Taking physiological data $\implies$ minimal distortion due to
        participants' own ideas, preferences etc
- Discoveries
    + Aesthetic mean : beauty is associated with the absence of extremes
- Daniel Berlyne's characterization of experimental aesthetics
    + Collative (structural/formal - familiar-novel, simple-complex,
        expected-surprising, ambiguous-clear and stable-variable)
    + Concentrate on motivational questions
    + Studies both nonverbal and verbally expressed judgements
    + Strives to establish connections between aesthetic and psychological
        phenomena
- Confirms aesthetic mean by plotting arousal potential as a Wundt curve
- Arousal potential categories
    + Intrinsic physical properties of music - tempo, volume. Faster/louder
        music has higher arousal potential
    + Ecological factors - signal value / meaningfulness of music
    + Collative variables (most significant) - More complex $\rightarrow$ higher
        arousal
- Psychobiological approach
    + Low arousal music $\rightarrow$ activity in pleasure centers, but none in
        displeasure centers of brain
    + Moderate arousal music $\rightarrow$ activity in pleasure centers maximal,
        begins to activate displeasure centers
    + High arousal music $\rightarrow$ activity in pleasure centers still
        maximal, increase displeasure as well

## Subjective complexity and repetition

- Objective measure of complexity : use probabilities, something like n grams
    for music where words are notes. Advantages - very precise, can automate analysis
- Subjective measure of complexity : ask listener how complex they think a
    particular piece is. Advantages - sits well with social-psychology of music
- As familiarity increases, objective complexity remains the same but subjective
    complexity decreases. Heyduk 1975 proposed, confirmed by Simonton 1987 with
    Beethoven's music and Erola with The Beatles

## Preference for prototypes

- Theory from cognitive psychology : humans prefer things that are classified
    easily
- Every object has a prototype
- Preference positively relates to prototypicality, since typical instances of
    any category give rise to a stronger activation of relevant cognitive
    representations
- In contrast with Berlyne's collative variables : prototypicality stronger than
    arousal-evoking qualities
- Well studied in visual arts
