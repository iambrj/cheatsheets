- Axioms : solver for problems
- Theorems : individual problems to be solved
- Proofs : computations generated by the solver

# Syntax

- Constants ::= 0-ary function symbols
- Predicate symbols, function symbols, variables : three mutually disjoint sets
  of symbols
- Term ::= variable
        |  f(t1,...,tk) where f is function symbol and ti are terms
- Atomic formula ::= P(t1,...,tk) where P is predicate symbol and ti are terms
- Clause : pair of sets of atomic formulas, e.g.
    ```
    B1, ..., Bm <- A1, ..., An
    ```
- Sentence in clausal form : set of clauses

# Semantics

- LHS (`B1, ..., Bm`) is disjunctions of atomic formulae
- RHS (`A1, ..., An`) is conjunctions of atomic formulae
- `<-` as implication
- Thus read
    ```
    B1, ..., Bm <- A1, ..., An
    ```
    As
    ```
    forall x1, ..., xk, B1 or ... or Bm
    is implied by A1 and ... and An
    ```

# Interesting phrases

- "To communicate, the programmer had to learn the psychology of the machine and
    to express his problems in machine-oriented terms"

# Thoughts

- Literally all of miniKanren is described in this paper that came out in 1974
