Implementing Compilers or Interpreters"'
author: Bharathi Ramana Joshi

- Outcomes
    + Minimize dependencies : to learn GC first learn compilers/interpreters
    + Flexible : should be able to explore alternate collecting strategies
    + Explorable : should handle non-trivial programs
    + Testing \& debugging : should be interchangeable with real garbage
        collector to debug
- Methodology
    + The API
