* In Prolog, an object refers to things that we can represent using *terms*
* Computer programming in Prolog consists of
	- specifying some **facts** about objects and their relationships
	- defining some **rules** about objects and their relationships
	- asking questions about objects and their relationships
# Facts
```
likes(john, mary).
```
* John likes Mary
* The names of all relationships and objects must begin with a lower-case letter
* The relationship is written first, the objects written separated by commas
* The dot character must come at the end of a fact
* Pick an arbitrary convention and stick to it - `likes(john, mary) !=
	likes(mary, john)`
* Names of the objects that are enclosed within the round brackets in each fact
	are called **arguments**
* The name of the relationship is called the **predicate**
* A collection of facts is called a **database**
# Questions
```
?-owns(mary, book)
```
* We can ask some **questions** about facts
* A question looks just like a fact, except that we put a special symbol before
	it - a question mark followed by a hyphen
* A question looks for facts that **unify** the fact in question
* Two facts **unify** if their predicates are the same, and if their
	corresponding arguments each are the same
# Variables
```
likes(john, mary).
likes(john, eliza)
?-likes(john, X).
X=mary?;
X=eliza
```
* Terms that stand for objects that we are unwilling or unable to name are
	called **variables**
* A variable can either be **instantiated** (there is an object that the
* variable stands for) or **not instantiated** (what the variable stands for is
	not yet known).
* Any name beginning with a capital letter is a variable
# Conjunctions
```
likes(mary, chocolate).
likes(mary, wine).
likes(john, wine).
likes(john, mary).
?-likes(john, mary), likes(mary, john).
```
* Use `,` to expresses conjunction
* Each goal keeps its own place-marker
* When working with a conjunction, Prolog attempts to satisfy each goal in turn,
	working from left to right
# Rules
* A **rule** is a general statement about objects and their relationships
* A **rule** consists of a **head** and  a **body** connected by a `:-` (if)
