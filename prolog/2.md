# Syntax
* Prolog programs are built from **terms**
* A **term** is either a constant, a variable, or a structure
* Each term is written as a sequence of **characters**
```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789
+-*/\~^<>:.?@#$&
```
## Constants
* **Constants** name specific objects or specific relationships. They are of two
	kinds - atoms and numbers
* **Atoms** are names - `likes`, `mary`, `john`, `book`, `wine` etc and some
	special symbols `?-` and `:-`
* Atoms made up of letters must start with lower-case letter
* Atoms enclosed in single quotes `'` can have any characters in its name
* An underline `_` character may be used in the middle of an atom to improve
	legibility
## Variables
* **Variables** look like atoms, except they have names beginning with a capital
	letter or an underline sign `_`.
* An **anonymous variable** can be written as a single underline character
* Anonymous variables ***never*** co-refer with any other variable, even other
	anonymous variables
```
?-likes(_, john).
```
## Structures
* Structures == compound terms
* A **structure** is a single object consisting of a collection of other
	objects, called **components**
* A **structure** is written in Prolog by specifying its **functor** and its
	**components**
* The **functor** names the general kind of structure, and corresponds to a
	datatype in an ordinary programming languages (is Prolog abnormal?)
* The **components** are enclosed in round brackets and separated by commas
```

```
# Operators
* `* `and `/` take precedence over `+` and `-`
* All arithmetic operators are left to right associative
```
X = Y
```
# Equality and Unification
```
?-X = Y
```
* Prolog will attempt to *unify* `X` and `Y`, and the goal succeeds if they
	unify
* Some rules
	- `X = X` for all `X`
	- If `X` is an uninstantiated variable, and if `Y` is instantiated to any
		term, then `X` and `Y` are equal. Furthermore, `X` will become
		instantiated to whatever `Y` is.
	- Two structures are equal if they have the same functor and number of
		corresponding components, and all the corresponding components are
		equal.
	- If two uninstantiated variables are attempted to equal, the **co-refer**
# Arithmetic
```
X =:= Y
X =\=  Y
X < Y
X > y
X =< Y
X >= Y
```
Note the different use of `=<` operator
* Prolog does not allow further facts to be added to predicates that are "built
	in" to Prolog.
* The `is` operator is an infix operator whose right-hand argument is a
	term which is interpreted as an arithmetic expression. Prolog first
	evaluates the right-hand argument according to the rules of arithmetic and
	unifies it with left-hand argument to check if the goal succeeds
```
X + Y
X - Y
X * Y
X / Y
X // Y
X mod Y
```
