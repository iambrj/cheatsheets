# What makes people unhappy?

- External discipline is the only road to happiness for those unfortunates whose
    self-absorption is too profound to be cured in any other way
- The Sinner : One who is absorbed in the consciousness of sin. Unattainable
    object - mother figure's approval
- The Narcissist : Vanity kills pleasure in every activity for its own sake and
    leads to listlessness and boredom. Cure is self-respect
- The megalomaniac : Desire for power than charm
- The typical unhappy man is one who, having been deprived in youth of some
    normal satisfaction, has come to value this one kind of satisfaction more
    than any other, and has therefore given to his life a one-sided direction,
    together with a quite undue emphasis upon the achievement as opposed to the
    activities connected with it.

# Byronic unhappiness

- The wise man will be as happy as circumstances permit
- Mood vs its intellectual expression
- Struggle and unfulfilled desires are part of life, but they don't *have* to be
    the *meaning* of life
- Trying to define the present as something only useful to give meaning to the
    future is a disaster

# Competition

- Comparing the competitive businessman with the Hindu widow
- Too much emphasis on competitive success as the main source of happiness,
    ironically, leads to unhappiness
- Education as a training in the capacity for enjoyment

# Boredom and excitement
