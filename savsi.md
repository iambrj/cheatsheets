# Chapter 1 : The Status of Sociology

- Characteristics of a good scientific theory
    1. internally consistent
    2. in accord with evidence
    3. constantly evolving - no true now and forever
    4. abandon failed theories
- Limitations of basing sociology on physical sciences
    1. Cannot perform experiments
        * Social experiment is itself a social event
        * Too complex to be broken down into simple isolated components for
            further examination
    2. Identifying regularities is not enough - *why* those regularities exist
       is a deeper question
    3. Circular problem - any attempt to study sociological phenomena
       contaminates the evidence, since attempting itself requires social
       interaction
