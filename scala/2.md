* Scala has two kinds of variables, vals and vars
	- `val` variable cannot be changed after it has been defined
	- `var` can be reassigned throughout its lifetime
* Type inference is the ability to figure out types that are left out
* In Scala, a variable's type is specified after its name
```
val msg: String = "Hello again, world!"
```
* Functions are defined as follows (note that the Scala compiler does not infer
  function parameter types)
```
def max(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
	if (x > y) x
	else y
}
```
* If a function is recursive, its return type must be explicitly specified
* If a contains just one sentence, curly braces can be left off
```
def max2(x: Int, y: Int) = if (x > y) x else y
```
* Command line arguments are available via an array named `args`
* A *function literal* is created as follows
```
(x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
```
* `foreach` can be used on arrays as follows
```
args.foreach(println)
```
* A *for expression* is used as follows
```
for (arg <- args)
	println(arg)
```
