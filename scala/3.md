* Objects/class instances can be instantiated using `new`
```
val big = new java.math.BigInteger("123456")
```
* Arrays are indexed by `()`, not `[]`
```
val greetStrings: Array[String] = new Array[String](3)
greetStrings(0) = "Hello"
greetStrings(1) = ", "
greetStrings(2) = "world!\n"
for(i <- 0 to 2)
	print(greetStrings(i))
```

`val` variables can't be reassigned, but the object to which it refers could
potentially still be changed.
