# Flexibility in Nature and in Design

- Additive programming : one should not modify an existing program, but be able
    to add to it to implement new functionality
- To suppress noise, make the outputs of one phase small and well defined than
    the acceptable inputs of the next phase. "Be conservative in what you do, be
    liberal in what you accept from others."
- Long term costs are additive rather than multiplicative
- Generic dispatch : have distinct response procedures for disjoint sets of
    inputs and dispatch the appropriate procedure
- Degeneracy : have multiple ways to compute something, which can be combined or
    modulated as needed
- Parti : an abstract plan for the computations to be performed
